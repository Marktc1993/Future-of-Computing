# Future-of-Computing


Computing needs a few things to change before it to become effective. There can be a world with regulated cryptocurrency.

With the advent of GPUs came the widespread adoption of Deep learning, with the surge in BitCoin mining we see a logical move towards ASICs which are specialized chips for this purpose.

Many hobbyist operations use GPUs which are incredibly inefficient at mining BitCoin or other cryptocurrencies. Here is an in-depth examination of the math behind cryptocurrency in the most intelligible and understandable way possible:

What we see is that GPUs were not designed for cryptocurrency thus they are grossly inefficient in mining operations. In the interest of power-consumption, it should be incentivized for GPUs to not be used for cryptocurrency mining.
GPUs invented by Nvidia were originally designed for video games, an enormous industry hell-bent on pushing out new hardware with improved graphics every few years to keep kids hooked. GPUs manage the low precision math behind the 
visuals for video games, moreover, these simulated spaces translate nicely into the deep learning applications, not the cryptocurrency space. Efficient cryptocurrency requires specialized chips like I mentioned above, moreover, deep 
learning and other statistical modeling practices may be better off receiving investment into FPGA chips or ASIC chips efficiently change the math operations given the models.

FPGA chips are programmable, thus you can set the hardware to the specifications of the software, which is not the norm for the industry currently, and then change it over time without having inventory turnover. ASIC chips have the 
hardware specifically designed for software needs and these are also very efficient. A good example of implemented ASIC chips is Google, who uses their own proprietary TPUs chips which are a form of ASIC for their own in-house deep 
learning operations. Also, Amazon and Microsoft are investing in their own chips FPGA chips. We occupy a shift in the computing landscape deliberation is necessary to make chips that can serve the wide usage that is being asked of them.
